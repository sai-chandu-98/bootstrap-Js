    <p>COVID-19 is a serious global infectious disease outbreak with nearly 550,000 cases and around 25,000 deaths worldwide. 
        It is part of a family of viruses called coronaviruses that infect both animals and people. 
        This particular one originated in China at the end of 2019, in the city of Wuhan, which has 11 million residents. 
        In the past two decades coronavirus outbreaks have caused global concern,
         including one in 2003 with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and 
         more recently in 2012 with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).</p>
